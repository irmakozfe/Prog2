Today felt like a blur but in a good way. I woke up a bit later than usual, around 9 a.m., and made myself some tea instead of coffee for once. The weather was warm but breezy—perfect for a short walk, so I went to the park nearby and sat under a tree for a while, just watching people pass by. Sometimes it’s nice to do absolutely nothing and not feel guilty about it.

In the afternoon, I had a burst of energy and worked on some Java exercises. I’m finally starting to understand how abstract classes and interfaces work. It actually felt kind of empowering. I even fixed a weird bug that had been bothering me for two days, so small win there!

I also listened to some music while cleaning—mostly indie stuff—and now my room smells like fresh laundry and lemon-scented candles. Not bad for a lazy Sunday.

Anyway, that’s it for now. Let's see what tomorrow brings.
